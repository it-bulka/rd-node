# Coffee Brew Log API 
This project demonstrates working with express.

## Installation
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/it-bulka/rd-node
    cd hw-4
    npm install
```

## Key Features
- **Layered Architecture** â€“ separate layers for DTOs, services, controllers, and routes.
- **Dependency Injection** â€“ using Awilix to register and inject services into controllers.
- **In-memory Storage** â€“ all data is stored within the BrewsService, avoiding global variables.
- **Validation with Zod** â€“ including custom validate() middleware for request validation.
- **Swagger UI** â€“ available at /docs; schemas are auto-generated from Zod via zod-to-openapi.
- **Query Filtering** â€“ supports filtering via query parameters (method and rating) in GET /api/brews.
- **Security Middleware** â€“ includes helmet, cors, and compression.
- **Rate Limiting** â€“ limits to 10 POST requests per minute (returns HTTP 429).
- **Logging** â€“ uses `morgan` for dev; `pino` in production.
- **Graceful Shutdown** â€“ handles SIGINT and SIGTERM, closing the HTTP server and disposing of the DI container.
- **ESBuild Bundling** â€“ builds with esbuild; output runs via `node dist/server.mjs`.
- **Multi-stage Docker Build** â€“ final image under 150MB; run with: <br>`docker run -p 3000:3000 brew-api`
